# Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms

This repository is a storage for all the materials created during the course: [Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms)

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LonelyMiko/Data-Structures-Algorithms.git
```
## What I was able to create while watching this course 
1. Data structures:
* Hash Tables
* Singly Linked Lists
* Queues
* Stacks
* Trees
* Graphs

2. Algorithms:
* Recursion
* Sorting
* Searching
* Tree Traversal (In progress)
* Breadth First Search (In progress)
* Depth First Search (In progress)
* Dynamic Programming (In progress)

If something is missing it means for some reason I didn't create it, if you want you can create the missing part or open a issue.
